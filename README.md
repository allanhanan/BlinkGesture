# BlinkGesture
## Blink twice to send Keyboard Shortcuts / Double blink Gesture

This program detects double blinks and triggers customizable keyboard shortcuts. 
It uses the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to accurately detect closed eyes and thus Blinks. 

### Press 'Start' 'Show Plot and Frame' to view eye landmarks and an EAR plot. 
Press 'Stop' to close these windows.
Adjust the consecutive frames for more precise double blink detection.
Customize keyboard shortcuts and choose actions that suit your needs. Ex: alt+tab, ctrl+win+right arrow, or just space if you're too lazy to pause the video like me 

### The App NO LONGER! only recogonizes the **Default Camera** of your Device
